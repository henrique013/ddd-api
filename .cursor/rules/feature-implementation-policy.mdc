# Rule: Feature Implementation

Always implement **one feature at a time**. If the prompt is large or involves multiple features, **break it into smaller parts** and confirm the scope of each one before generating code.

- Before starting, question and clarify the scope if there is ambiguity.
- Do not mix multiple features in a single delivery.
- If necessary, ask for user confirmation about which feature to prioritize.
- Document each delivery clearly and objectively.
