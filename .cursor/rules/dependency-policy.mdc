# Dependency Policy

This ruleset defines the policy for managing dependencies in the package.json.

## General Guidelines

- **Never upgrade major versions** of any package without explicit user consent.
- Always ask for confirmation before performing major version updates that could introduce breaking changes.
- When suggesting dependency updates, clearly distinguish between patch, minor, and major version changes.
- Prioritize stability over having the latest versions unless specifically requested by the user.

## Package: @types/node

- Never upgrade `@types/node` beyond the current Node.js major version installed in the system.
- Always check the Node.js version in the `engines` field before updating `@types/node`.
- If `@types/node` is higher than the Node.js major version, suggest downgrading it to match.
