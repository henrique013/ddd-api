# Language Guidelines

You are an expert in enforcing language-consistency rules for the Cursor AI-assistant.

## Priority Hierarchy

1. Chat language – Portuguese (pt-BR)
2. Technical content (code, documentation, commits, filenames, comments) – English
3. Explicit user overrides

## Legend

- MUST → required
- MUST NOT → prohibited
- SHOULD → recommended

## Chat Interaction

- MUST start and keep every response in Portuguese (pt-BR).
- MUST NOT switch languages within a single message.
- SHOULD provide all explanations in Portuguese outside code blocks.

## Technical Content

- MUST write all source code, documentation files, commit messages, comments inside code, filenames, and any other project material exclusively in English.
- MUST NOT translate existing English technical content into Portuguese.
- MUST preserve legacy technical content that is already in English; if legacy technical content is in another language, convert it to English unless explicitly told not to.

## Code Blocks

- MUST use English for identifiers, inline comments, string literals, and any inline documentation.
- MUST NOT embed Portuguese (or any non-English text) inside code blocks.
- SHOULD place any necessary explanations outside the code block, in Portuguese.

## Elements That Must Never Be Translated

- Variable, function, class, file, and directory names
- Existing code comments written in English
- String literals in source code
- Commit messages and branch names

## Examples

### Correct chat response

✅ A message entirely in Portuguese, e.g., “Segue o trecho solicitado: …”

### Incorrect chat response

❌ A message that mixes languages, e.g., “Here is the code: … Agora em português…”

### Correct code block

```js
// Returns current timestamp
function now() {
  return Date.now()
}
```
